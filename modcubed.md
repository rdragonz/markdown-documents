## Tips, Tricks, and Guides

Coming soon!!

## Installing

To install ModCubed, you will need a few things. Don't worry, these steps may seem long but they're not that complicated! Most of the guide is just installing Java 8 in a way that doesn't mess up your main Java install, and installing MultiMC! If you already have Java 8 installed and you know where it's installed on your computer, you can skip to step 2 to set up MultiMC. If you already have MultiMC installed *and* Java 8, skip to step 3 to download and install the modpack.

Also to note, these steps are for Windows. If you use MacOS or Linux, you're on your own for the Java installation, although the steps for MultiMC are basically the same.
 
First, you're going to need to download a few things. Click the following links to visit the download pages for the relevant applications:

- [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/#Download)
- [AdoptOpenJDK 8](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=windows&arch=x64&version=8)

For AdoptOpenJDK, make sure you download the JRE release in MSI format instead of the JDK release. The JDK release is a bit bigger, and contains some things that we don't entirely need!

### Step 1 - Installing Java 8

Simply run the installer. When it presents you with the page for "Custom setup", make sure to disable the "Add to PATH" option by clicking on the icon next to the option and then selecting "Entire feature will be unavailable" from the dropdown.

![](https://i.imgur.com/sepa9tA.png)

If you leave the option enabled, the Java installation on your computer may become incorrect and lead to issues with other programs that rely on newer versions of Java!!

Also make note of the "Location" section at the bottom, as we will need this later!

![](https://i.imgur.com/40FwLEH.png)

Finally, just click through the installer.

### Step 2 - Installing MultiMC

**!! STOP !!**

If you have skipped step 1 based on the intro paragraph, it's assumed that you already have Java 8 installed and you know the path to the installation folder. If you don't know where it was installed, or you are not sure if you have Java 8 installed properly, go back and review step 1!

---

Open the Zip file for MultiMC, and drag and drop the "MultiMC" folder to a location somewhere on your computer. For these instructions I will put the folder on my desktop, but it can be placed anywhere.

![](https://i.imgur.com/wFpWfJz.png)

From here, simply open the folder and run the "MultiMC.exe" file to start MultiMC.

![](https://i.imgur.com/WpV1pBt.png)

If you'd like to pin the file to your task bar, desktop, or start menu, you can right-click on MultiMC.exe and hit "Create Shortcut", and then drag and drop the newly-created shortcut wherever you'd like!

![](https://i.imgur.com/FbJuqrs.png)

Once you've started MultiMC, select your language and hit "Next". Skip the next step and just hit "Finish". From here, hit the "Profiles" button in the top right, and then click "Manage Accounts".

![](https://i.imgur.com/xALjrP6.png)

In the newly-opened settings window, hit "Add Microsoft" in the top right and then follow the instructions to sign in and authorize your Microsoft account. Once you're signed in, head back to MultiMC and close the open settings window to continue!

### Step 3 - Installing the modpack

**!! STOP !!**

If you skipped the first two steps based on the intro paragraph, it's assumed that you have Java 8 installed, you know where Java 8 is on your computer, and that you have MultiMC installed and your Microsoft account authorized with the program! If you're not sure, please go back and review the previous steps!

---

Once you have MultiMC installed and your Microsoft account authorized, hit the "Add Instance" button in the top left. From here, select "Import from zip" option, and then paste the modpack download URL in the box.

![](https://i.imgur.com/nBW7Xmc.png)

From here, hit OK and the modpack will download. This may take a moment!

Once the modpack has downloaded, single-click on it and then hit "Edit Instance" on the right.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Pak7udX.png)

From here, make sure the "Version" tab is selected and then click "Download All" in the lower right. This will download all the assets for Minecraft itself from Mojang, and will again take a moment.

![](https://i.imgur.com/0BZEmrt.png)

Once that's done, the final step is to configure the modpack to use the correct version of Java. To do this, click the "Java" tab on the left and then click "Browse". If there is already something in the box above, ignore it.

![](https://i.imgur.com/FuDcpT3.png)

From here, we will need to navigate to that "Location" folder we made a note of earlier. By default, this will be at the following location:

    C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jre-8.0.392.8-hotspot

**!! IMPORTANT!!**

This location may be different on your computer! Please make sure you're not copy-pasting everything exactly and that you're double-checking that you're browsing to the "Location" folder you saw when you installed Java!!

If there are multiple folders under the "Eclipse Adoptium" folder, make sure you pick the one that starts with "jre-8".

From here, enter the "bin" folder.

![](https://i.imgur.com/bFK2Iar.png)

Finally, scroll down until you find a file called "javaw.exe", click on it, and then hit open.

Congratulations, you've finished! Go ahead and test everything out by hitting "Launch" in the bottom right!
